"""Re-derive every number quoted in Paper 3 from the committed CSVs.

Paper C's outline has `claims_audit.py`; Paper 3 had nothing, and it was edited heavily on
2026-08-12 -- section 3 rewritten from a new table, section 7's concession rewritten, the
dataset count moved from eight to eleven, the endpoint tally from five to six, and a
three-metric section added. Every one of those touched numbers that appear in more than one
file. A paper whose entire argument is a bound cannot afford a figure that only one document
believes.

This checks the manuscript against the data, not against itself. Anything that cannot be
recomputed is reported as UNVERIFIABLE rather than assumed right.
